# FairFarm: A Platform for Connecting Farmers with Local Markets

## Problem Statement

How might we develop a solution for **connecting farmers with local markets**, enabling **real-time price discovery**, **efficient supply chain management**, and **fair pricing for agricultural produce**?

The agricultural industry faces various challenges, including inefficiencies in market access, lack of price transparency, and an underdeveloped supply chain. Farmers often face difficulties in getting fair prices for their produce and lack direct access to local markets.

Our goal is to provide an integrated platform that:

- Enables **real-time price discovery**.
- Connects **farmers with local buyers**.
- Optimizes the **supply chain** for more efficiency.
- Ensures **fair pricing** for agricultural produce.


## Solution Overview

FairFarm implements a robust backend system using FastAPI to handle:

- **Real-time price updates** for agricultural products, scraped from various local markets.
- **Farmers' product listings** connected to buyers through an intuitive UI.
- **Efficient logistics and supply chain management**, integrating with local transport systems to ensure timely deliveries.


## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: FastAPI for building scalable REST APIs.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **Machine Learning**: Price prediction using Random Forest or XGBoost models.
- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the app for easy deployment.

## Features

- **User Management**: Farmers, buyers, and transporters can register and authenticate via JWT.
- **Price Prediction**: Real-time price forecasts for agricultural produce using machine learning.
- **Market Matching**: Buyers and sellers are matched based on proximity and product availability.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment gateways to facilitate transactions between farmers and buyers.


## Enhance Market Matching & Price Prediction

This issue focuses on refining the **real-time price discovery** and improving the **market matching system** to ensure better connectivity between farmers and buyers. The goal is to make the platform more efficient by implementing **AI-driven recommendations** and expanding the **supply chain management** features.
